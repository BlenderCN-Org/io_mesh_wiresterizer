# Wiresterizer format
The Wiresterizer format was originally designed for a software quadrilateral wireframe rasterizer.

I might expand it in the future to serve other software rasterizer needs.

# Features
* Binary and human-readable modes
* Exports vertex position
* Choose between triangles/quads/n-gons
* Exports face normals (optional)
* Exports vertex normals (optional)
* Supports explicitly setting endianness

# TODO
* N-gon mode face vertex count should be an 8-bit int
* Endianness drop-down (system/little/big)
* Vertex normals
* Indexed mode

# TODO (expansion)
* Various vertex/attribute/dimension layouts
* Materials
* Textures and UV coordinates
* Animation

# Binary format specifications

# Text format specifications
